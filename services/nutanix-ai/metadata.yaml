  # Overview
  NAI GPT-in-a-Box

  GPT-in-a-Box is a comprehensive inference endpoint management product designed to streamline and
  optimize your AI model orchestration experience. GPT-in-a-Box allows you to select, deploy, and manage
  large language models (LLMs) on a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy GPT-in-a-Box on any Kubernetes distribution, 
  including Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (NKP), and public cloud Kubernetes platforms 
  such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
  
  **Note: Only install the Nutanix AI once per workspace.**

  # Key features
  - Model access integration
      GPT-in-a-Box supports selecting and deploying text-based generative AI LLMs from Hugging Face.
  - API endpoint integration
      GPT-in-a-Box supports creating an API endpoint and sharing it with developers to incorporate into
      their AI applications. You can also manage and validate these endpoints to ensure that they are
      configured correctly.
  - API-based access control
      GPT-in-a-Box supports accessing an endpoint by an application using API keys. API key
      management allows you to provide and revoke API access to ensure proper access security
      controls.
  - User access and role-based access control
      GPT-in-a-Box supports role-based access control (RBAC), which you can configure to provide
      customized access permissions to users based on their assigned roles. The Users dashboard
      displays information about all the defined roles.
  - Enterprise user interface
      GPT-in-a-Box has a simple and dynamic user interface that streamlines your deployment processes
      using one-click deployment.
  - Metrics dashboard
      GPT-in-a-Box has a dynamic dashboard where you can monitor the health of your deployment with
      real-time monitoring tools that identify bottlenecks, track performance, and troubleshoot issues.
  - Dark site deployment
      GPT-in-a-Box provides support for deploying secure models in a dark site.
  - Built-in support for Nutanix products
      GPT-in-a-Box supports seamless integration with existing Nutanix products, thus providing a robust
      and compliant solution.

  # Pre-requisite
  Create the storage class named nai-nfs-storage using Nutanix Files share storage by replacing <nfs-path> and <nfs-server> 
      in the following manifest, then execute it:
      ```
      cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - \n
      apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
      kind: StorageClass
      metadata:
        name: nai-nfs-storage
      parameters:
        nfsPath: <nfs-path>
        nfsServer: <nfs-server>
        storageType: NutanixFiles
      provisioner: csi.nutanix.com
      reclaimPolicy: Delete
      volumeBindingMode: Immediate
      EOF
